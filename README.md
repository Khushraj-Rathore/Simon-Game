## Introduction

Simon is a memory game where the player needs to repeat a sequence of colors that are displayed in a random order. Each time the player repeats the sequence correctly, the sequence grows, and the game becomes more challenging. The game ends when the player makes a mistake, and the game will prompt them to restart.

This version of Simon is built using:
- **HTML** for the structure.
- **CSS** for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** for game logic, including user input, sequence generation, and error handling.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure and layout for the game interface.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the game buttons, background, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic, button presses, and sequence control.

## Features

- Colorful flashing sequence that increases in complexity.
- Sound effects to provide feedback for each correct or incorrect move.
- Simple and clean interface for easy gameplay.
- Score tracking to see how far you've gone.
- Restart functionality after game over.
- Responsive design to fit different screen sizes.

## How to Play

1. The game will start with a random color sequence that you need to repeat by clicking the corresponding color buttons in the same order.
2. Each time you successfully repeat the sequence, the game will add another color to the sequence.
3. If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game continues, and the sequence grows longer.
4. If you click the wrong button, you lose the game, and it will display a message showing your score.
5. You can restart the game by refreshing the page or clicking the restart button.
